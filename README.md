The Russian-Ukrainian war is described in the New Testament.
It explicitly says that the 'Bear', Russia, will go into the
south and cause war there, the Ukraine. It further states
that the 'Dragon' will rise up agains the 'Bear' and
defeat his, Putin, armies. Now you ask, who is the 
'Dragon'? Well the answer is China. The Chinese will
move up from the south and help the Ukrainians, as
the Bible stares, "utterly obliterate the Bear"
